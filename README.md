Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize HR metrics such as attrition rate, employee demographics, job satisfaction, salary trends, and tenure.

Analyzed data for 1,473 employees to uncover key insights like high attrition among employees earning under $5K and those with 0â€“5 years of tenure.

Used charts (bar, line, pie) and filters (department, gender) to enable dynamic reporting for HR decision-making.

Highlighted attrition trends by age, salary, education field, and job role, aiding in targeted retention strategies.
